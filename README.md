# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization using Plotly

This project performs an end-to-end analysis of COVID-19 data using Python,
focusing on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, time-series trends, and
interactive visualizations.

The analysis was developed in Google Colab and visualized using Plotly Express.


## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand the global impact of COVID-19 through:
- Country-wise and continent-wise comparisons
- Time-series analysis of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries
- Daily new cases and rolling averages
- Geographic spread using interactive world maps
- Text-based analysis of conditions associated with COVID-19 deaths


## 🔑 Key Features

- Top countries comparison using bar charts
- Bubble charts for continent-level analysis
- Global and country-specific (USA) time-series trends
- Log-scale visualization for exponential growth
- Daily new cases and 7-day rolling averages
- Static and animated world choropleth maps
- WordCloud visualization for COVID-19 death-related conditions


## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly Express
- Matplotlib
- WordCloud
- Google Colab
